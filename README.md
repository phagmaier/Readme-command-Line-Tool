# README COMMAND-LINE TOOL
## DESCRIPTION
Created a simple terminal program to add a title of the project a description and create a file table. Making a README can be boring and wanted to automate some of it and this is what I have for now it's simple and can easily be exapanded. I'm sure better ones exist but I like this as a boilerplate generator. it is also convenient for adding all files in a path to a table with relative links or adding only files  that end in a particular extension in a particular directory.
